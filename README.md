Environmental data server / viewer (not SOS but maybe later)

This is the technology of a complete environmental information system,
which comprises a web browser based user application, database, and
data server. The user application comprises a PHP/HTML part and a
JavaScript part. The JavaScript part depends on OpenLayers, Flot, and
jQuery. The database / data server part is designed to be completely
separate from the user application and may be at a completely
different server. PostgreSQL/PostGIS database is used and the server
software is written in Perl. The WFS of Geoinformatica is used.
